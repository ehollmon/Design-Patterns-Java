Popular Design Patterns written in Java.

## Adapter Design Pattern

This pattern works as a bridge between two incompatible interfaces. It is considered a type of structural pattern as this pattern combines the capability of two independent interfaces. The Adapter's extra level of indirection provides user-friendly  mapping to legacy-specific/peculiar interfaces.

## Decorator
This pattern allows you to modify and object dynamically without affecting the behavior of other objects from the same class. It is considered to be a structural pattern. It creates a decorator class which wraps the original class and provides additional functionality keeping class methods signature intact.

## Factory

This pattern allows your to create objects without specifying the exact class of object that will be created at runtime. It is considered a type of creational pattern . It defines an interface or abstract class for creating an object but the subclasses decide which class to instantiate.

## Mediator
This pattern aims to reduce communication complexity between multiple objects or classes. It is considered a type of behavioral pattern . It uses a mediator class that handles communications between different classes and provides easy maintenance of the code by loose coupling.

## Proxy Design Pattern

This pattern provides a class that will limit access to another class. It is considered a type of structural pattern. The Proxy's extra level of indirection enables distributed, controlled, or intelligent access.

## Singleton

This pattern aims to eliminate the option of instantiating more than one object. It is considered a type of creational pattern . It's one of the best ways to create an object it provides a single class which is responsible to create an object while making sure that only single object gets created.

## Template
This pattern provides a skeleton for performing any sort of algorithm or an operation, and it allows the sub-classes to re-define part of the logic. It is considered a type of behavioral pattern. A Base class declares algorithm 'placeholders', and derived classes implement the placeholders.
